	EnumEntry_StreamBufferHandlingMode_OldestFirst
		Access Mode: RO
		Desc: The application always gets the buffer from the head of the output buffer queue (thus, the oldest available one). If the output buffer queue is empty, the application waits for a newly acquired buffer until the timeout expires.
		Children: 
	EnumEntry_StreamBufferHandlingMode_OldestFirstOverwrite
		Access Mode: RO
		Desc: The application always gets the buffer from the head of the output buffer queue (thus, the oldest available one). If the output buffer queue is empty, the application waits for a newly acquired buffer until the timeout expires. If a new buffer arrives it will overwrite the existing buffer from the head of the queue (behaves like a circular buffer).
		Children: 
	EnumEntry_StreamBufferHandlingMode_NewestFirst
		Access Mode: RO
		Desc: The application always gets the buffer from the tail of the output buffer queue (thus, the newest available one). If the output buffer queue is empty, the application waits for a newly acquired buffer until the timeout expires.
		Children: 
	EnumEntry_StreamBufferHandlingMode_NewestFirstOverwrite
		Access Mode: RO
		Desc: DEPRECATED.  This is replaced by NewestOnly.
		Children: 
	EnumEntry_StreamBufferHandlingMode_NewestOnly
		Access Mode: RO
		Desc: The application always gets the latest completed buffer (the newest one).  If the Output Buffer Queue is empty, the application waits for a newly acquired buffer until the timeout expires.  This buffer handling mode is typically used in a live display GUI where it is important that there is no lag between camera and display.
